Hi, I'm Zeinab 👋

I'm a Machine Learning researcher and Python developer with a unique background that bridges Computer Engineering and Physics.
My main focus lies in applying deep learning and computer vision techniques to astronomical data, aiming to enhance the automation and precision of scientific discovery.

🪐 Research & Technical Interests:

- Deep Learning & Computer Vision
- Data Analysis & Time-Series Classification
- Python Development and Data Visualization
- Web Backend Development with Django (Model Deployment & API Integration)

🚀 Highlighted Projects:

- Exoplanet Detection using Vision Transformers (ViT)
 Developed an automated classification pipeline for detecting exoplanets from TESS light curves.
 The model achieved F1 = 0.89, Precision = 0.94, and Recall = 0.85, outperforming previous architectures.

- Occultation Timing Mobile App
 Designed the first mobile application for occultation and timing analysis — presented in Germany, the USA, and Russia.
 Awarded 2nd place in Iran’s national Saha Astronomy Software Competition.

- HurTech (Startup Project)
 Founder and lead developer of HurTech, a selected project in the International Innovation Exhibition (INOTEX).

- Game Development
 Member of an indie game development team — awarded in a national game design competition.
